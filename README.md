# OrionSoft Phonics Trainer
## Ryan Black    Last Updated: 15 OCT 2023

## Description
The **OrionSoft Phonics Trainer** is a GUI application designed to help users (toddlers) improve their pronunciation of English letters. The user is prompted to pronounce a series of letters, which the application then attempts to recognize using Google's Web Speech API. If the pronunciation is correct, the user advances to the next letter. If incorrect, the user receives feedback on what the system recognized.

## Features
- Real-time volume visualization
- Integration with Google Web Speech API for speech recognition
- Feedback system to inform users about the correctness of their pronunciation
- Simple and intuitive GUI

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - tkinter
  - numpy
  - pyaudio
  - pydub (with ffmpeg)
  - speech_recognition

pip install numpy pyaudio pydub SpeechRecognition
```

## Setup & Installation

## Usage
